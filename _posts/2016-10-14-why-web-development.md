## Beginnings

  I have always had an interest in technology. From building my own computers or trying out new ROMs on my Samsung Galaxy S3. I like to know how things work. But to go from a hobby to a full-time position in technology was a scary proposition. Not the position itself but how to begin. I had heard of front-end web development boot-camps but it took a chance meeting with an engineer from NASA to convince me that boot-camps were a viable option to get my foot in the door.
  
  
## Chance meeting
  
  I was working as a recruiter at the time for a governement contractor and I was looking for candidates for a particular position. I called an engineer to see if he would be interested in a position. He was not but he graciously listened to what I had to say. At the end of the phone call, I asked him what his plans were to gauge if I might be able to assist him in the future. He told me of his plan to go to a web development boot-camp and then create a startup with two of his friends. 
  
  After that I began to research web development boot-camps, prices, location and reviews. When I was laid off from my position I decided it was a perfect time to go after my dream.

## Coding

   My life separated into three parts. However I have had dreams about coding. Since I began this process I've noticed that even in my free time away from it, I think about how to solve a particular problem or what could be done better. I say that in a good way because of how much I enjoy it.
