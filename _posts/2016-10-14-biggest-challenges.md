## Mistakes
   When I first started my journey of learning to program I was afraid to make mistakes. I thought my code needed to be perfect everytime, all the time. And if it wasn't then I was a failure. Perfection however is unrealistic. Once I understood that it was ok to make mistakes and that it was part of the process, it felt as if a large weight had been lifted from my shoulders. 

## Ask for help
   Once I got over my initial ideal that my code needed to be perfect, it opened up many avenues of learning. I was able to look for and ask for help. And that is a great thing, the development community is absolutely amazing. The time people sacrifice to help each other or to point someone in the right direction surprised me because I had never seen such comraderie before.
   
## Enjoy the journey
   One of the best quotes I can think of when starting a new project or topic is, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step." This quote always helps me keep perspective not only that anything worth doing takes time, but also that it is the journey that matters. Chances are that the way things are done now will change, different languages or different methods, but that is what makes technology and development so exciting.
