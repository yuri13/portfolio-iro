#Front End Development
I have to admit learning to code has not always been an easy journey. There have been more than a few bumps in the road, but today I received my Front End Development certificate from Free Code Camp. It feels good to have completed this portion of their program but there is alot more to learn and I have already begun the Back End Development section.
