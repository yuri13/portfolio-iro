#Coffee Breaks
   The importance of breaks should not be overlooked. According to a study done by the School of Busines at Baylor University, taking short, frequent breaks leads to: "higher job satsifaction; reduced emotional exhaustion; and greater efforts by employees." When I first began learning to code I would take one break at lunch to eat. My body felt the strain after my second week. Now that I take breaks throughout the day, even if it just to stretch my legs by going outside to play with my dogs for a bit, I notice the difference in my body physically.
