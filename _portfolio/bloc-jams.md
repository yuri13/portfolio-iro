# Explanation

   The Bloc-jams project was designed by Bloc to teach specific topics to students in the Front End Web Development program.

# Problems

* One of the issues to solve for the Bloc-Jams project was to ensure that it was responsive to different screen sizes and devices.

* Another issue was how to program easier as opposed to JavaScript.

* The third issue was how to make Bloc-Jams more dynamic.


# Solutions

* The solution to this issue was to use media queries. Media queries can be used to look at the width and height of a device, in addition to its orientation and resolution.

* Using jQuery helps to code faster and easier compared to JavaScript. However there are tradeoffs with the switch. jQuery will run slower because its library is running alongside your own code.

* To make Bloc-Jams more dynamic web transitions were used. CSS transitions can be used to change certain properties over a certain period of time.

# Conclusions

   The main purpose of this project was to familiarize students with Front End Web Development topics. I believe it was a success and more, in that it was thought provoking and fun. Learning how things work or don't work and finding how to fix them is one of the most enjoyable things in life.
